    "Ans : Predictive modeling can be used to analyze patterns from historical employee data, identifying factors that contribute to attrition. By analyzing key indicators like job satisfaction, performance, and tenure, we can build a model that predicts the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization, enabling HR teams to focus on retention strategies, and prevent the loss of good employees"
